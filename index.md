### Week 2

We decided on which [repository](https://github.com/kylesyCENG317/Active-House-) we're using. 
We also made our proposals in excel and document form and uploaded them to the our repository. 
We also had a discussion with Austin about the fundamentals of our system; we concluded that the raspberry pi will serve as the gateway between the arduino and our cloud/database. Lastly we resothered the Xbee shield because there were some errors with the previous sothering.

### Week 1
Made our teams. This team is to be composed of Kyle, Vishwas and Oliver. Austin talked about troubleshooting. We startted working on our proposals and discussed a system that we have in a previous hardware/software course.

### Welcome!
